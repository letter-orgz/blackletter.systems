# Story Enhancement Tools

Tools to automatically enhance draft stories to meet Definition of Ready (DoR) requirements.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Enhance All Draft Stories
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
./tools/enhance_all_draft_stories.sh
```

### Option 2: Enhance Specific Story
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
python tools/story_enhancement_template.py docs/stories/2.3-weak-language-lexicon.md
```

## What Gets Enhanced

Each draft story gets the following sections added/modified:

### âœ… Required Sections Added

1. **Detailed Tasks/Subtasks**
   - Backend implementation tasks
   - Frontend/UI tasks (if applicable)
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation tasks

2. **Comprehensive Dev Notes**
   - Technical specifications
   - File paths and repository structure
   - API contracts and data formats
   - Testing strategy
   - UX implications
   - Test data requirements

3. **Complete Dev Agent Record**
   - Proposed implementation tasks
   - Dependencies with story references
   - Open technical decisions
   - Implementation guidelines

4. **Change Log**
   - Enhancement tracking
   - Version history

## Definition of Ready Compliance

The enhanced stories meet all DoR requirements:

- âœ… **Acceptance criteria written** - Preserved from original
- âœ… **Test data identified** - Added with specific fixture paths
- âœ… **UX implications defined** - Added for each story type
- âœ… **Dependencies listed** - Structured with story references

## Customization

After running the enhancement:

1. **Review the enhanced story** - Check for accuracy
2. **Customize technical specs** - Update file paths, APIs, etc.
3. **Verify dependencies** - Ensure correct story references
4. **Add specific details** - Technology choices, data formats
5. **Update status** - Change to `approved` when ready

## Files Created

- `tools/story_enhancement_template.py` - Main enhancement script
- `tools/enhance_all_draft_stories.sh` - Batch processing script
- `tools/STORY_ENHANCEMENT_README.md` - This documentation

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyYAML library (`pip install PyYAML`)
- Bash shell (for batch script)

## Example Output

Before enhancement:
```yaml
status: draft
tasks: []
```

After enhancement:
```yaml
status: draft
tasks_subtasks: |
  - [ ] **Backend Service**
    - [ ] Create service class following dependency injection pattern
    - [ ] Implement core business logic with proper error handling
  - [ ] **Testing**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for service logic
    - [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints

dev_notes: |
  **Technical Specification:**
  - Service interfaces and method signatures
  - Data models and validation schemas

dev_agent_record:
  proposed_tasks:
    - backend: Implement core service logic
    - tests: Comprehensive test coverage
  dependencies:
    - story: X.X-dependency-name (description)
```

## Manual Enhancement

If you prefer to enhance stories manually, follow this checklist:

### Required Sections
- [ ] `tasks_subtasks` - Detailed, actionable implementation steps
- [ ] `dev_notes` - Technical specifications and requirements
- [ ] `dev_agent_record` - Implementation guidance and dependencies
- [ ] `change_log` - Enhancement tracking

### DoR Verification
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Test data requirements clearly specified
- [ ] UX implications documented (or explicitly "None")
- [ ] Dependencies properly linked with story IDs
- [ ] File paths follow repository structure
- [ ] Technical specifications complete

This ensures stories are truly development-ready! ðŸŽ¯
