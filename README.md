# Blackletter - Contract Analysis Platform

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: MVP CORE COMPLETE!** 

The orchestra agent has successfully implemented a **fully functional contract analysis pipeline**. The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development.

## 🚀 **What's Working Right Now**

✅ **Complete Backend Pipeline**
- File upload & job orchestration (PDF/DOCX support)
- Text extraction with sentence indexing
- GDPR Article 28 detection engine
- Evidence window building
- Findings persistence & storage

✅ **Production Ready Services**
- FastAPI application with CORS & logging
- Background task processing
- Rulepack loading & validation
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

## 📋 **Quick Start**

### Setup Script (macOS/Linux)
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and sets up pre-commit hooks.

### Backend (Ready to Run)
```bash
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn blackletter_api.main:app --reload
```

> **Note**: The in-memory orchestrator uses thread locks for safety but
> remains process-local. Deployments that scale across multiple processes
> or machines should replace it with a shared persistence layer.

### Frontend (Ready for Development)
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **Next Development Priorities**

### Ready to Start (Epic 2 Completion)
1. **Weak Language Lexicon Enhancement** - Expand detection capabilities
2. **Token Ledger Caps** - Implement usage tracking & limits
3. **Findings Table Frontend** - Build React components for results display

### Short Term (Epics 3-5)
- **Analysis & Reporting** - Dashboard, export, history
- **Metrics & Monitoring** - Real-time performance tracking
- **Organization & Auth** - User management & access control
