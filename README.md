Blackletter is a GDPR Processor Obligations Checker designed to automate the review of vendor contracts against the eight obligations outlined in Article 28(3) of the GDPR. The tool provides deterministic, explainable checks with pinpoint citations and clear rationale for each finding.

## Features

- **Deterministic Analysis**: Rule-based engine with clear, explainable decisions
- **GDPR Compliance**: Specialized in Article 28(3) compliance checks
- **Evidence-First Approach**: Every finding includes cited evidence and rationale
- **Fast Processing**: Sub-60 second processing time for most contracts
- **Cost-Effective**: Significantly lower cost than manual legal review
- **Exportable Reports**: PDF/HTML reports suitable for sharing with stakeholders

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **TypeScript 5.x**
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x**
- **shadcn/ui** with Radix primitives
- **React Query** for data fetching

### Backend
- **Python 3.11+**
- **FastAPI 0.11x**
- **PyMuPDF** for PDF processing
- **blingfire** for sentence segmentation
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0.x** for ORM

### Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL** for production
- **FastAPI BackgroundTasks** for async processing

## Quick Start (Windows)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/blackletter.git
   cd blackletter
   ```

2. One-time setup (creates `.venv`, installs deps, creates `.env`, preps `.data`):
   ```powershell
   # From repo root
   pwsh -NoProfile -File .\setup.ps1
   # Then activate the venv for your session
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Start the API (from repo root):
   ```powershell
   uvicorn blackletter_api.main:app --reload --app-dir apps/api
   ```

4. (Optional) Serve demo UIs (run in another terminal):
   ```powershell
   python -m http.server 8080
   # Open http://localhost:8080/docs/artifacts/job_status_demo.html
   # or   http://localhost:8080/docs/artifacts/job_status_ui.html
   ```

### Environment Variables

Configuration is read from `.env` (generated by `setup.ps1`). Key toggles:

- `JOB_SYNC` — set to `1` to run background jobs synchronously (useful for tests)
- `ANALYSES_FS_ENABLED` — set to `1` to list analyses by scanning `.data/analyses`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — comma-separated list of allowed origins (or `*`)
- `DATA_ROOT` — data directory (default `.data`)
- `WEAK_LEXICON_ENABLED` — set to `0` to disable the weak language post-processor
