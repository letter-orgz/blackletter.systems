Blackletter is a GDPR Processor Obligations Checker designed to automate the review of vendor contracts against the eight obligations outlined in Article 28(3) of the GDPR. The tool provides deterministic, explainable checks with pinpoint citations and clear rationale for each finding.

## Features

- **Deterministic Analysis**: Rule-based engine with clear, explainable decisions
- **GDPR Compliance**: Specialized in Article 28(3) compliance checks
- **Evidence-First Approach**: Every finding includes cited evidence and rationale
- **Fast Processing**: Sub-60 second processing time for most contracts
- **Cost-Effective**: Significantly lower cost than manual legal review
- **Exportable Reports**: PDF/HTML reports suitable for sharing with stakeholders

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **TypeScript 5.x**
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x**
- **shadcn/ui** with Radix primitives
- **React Query** for data fetching

### Backend
- **Python 3.11+**
- **FastAPI 0.11x**
- **PyMuPDF** for PDF processing
- **blingfire** for sentence segmentation
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0.x** for ORM

### Infrastructure
- **SQLite** for development
- **PostgreSQL** for production
- **FastAPI BackgroundTasks** for async processing

## Development

### Full Stack (API + Frontend)

This is the standard setup for running the full application with the Python backend and Next.js frontend.

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- npm or yarn

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/blackletter.git
   cd blackletter
   ```

2. One-time setup (creates `.venv`, installs deps, creates `.env`, preps `.data`):
   ```powershell
   # From repo root
   pwsh -NoProfile -File .\setup.ps1
   # Then activate the venv for your session
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. Start the API (from repo root):
   ```powershell
   uvicorn blackletter_api.main:app --reload --app-dir apps/api
   ```

4. Start the Frontend (run in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix apps/web
   npm run dev --prefix apps/web
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend-Only (Mock Mode)

This setup is ideal for frontend development without needing to run the Python backend. The frontend will use mocked data.

1. **Navigate to the web app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   ```

2. **Create an environment file:**
   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the `apps/web` directory and add the following line:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and run the server:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Mocked Routes
When in mock mode, the following routes are available with mocked data:
- `/dashboard`: Displays a list of mock analyses.
- `/analyses/mock-1`: Shows a detail page for a mock analysis.
- `/reports`: Shows a list of mock reports generated via the "Export" feature.

### Environment Variables

Configuration is read from `.env` (generated by `setup.ps1`). Key toggles:

- `JOB_SYNC` — set to `1` to run background jobs synchronously (useful for tests)
- `ANALYSES_FS_ENABLED` — set to `1` to list analyses by scanning `.data/analyses`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — comma-separated list of allowed origins (or `*`)
- `DATA_ROOT` — data directory (default `.data`)
- `WEAK_LEXICON_ENABLED` — set to `0` to disable the weak language post-processor
