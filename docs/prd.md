## 3. User Interface Design Goals
### Overall UX Vision
The core UX vision is to transform the complex and often intimidating process of legal analysis into a clear, trustworthy, and efficient experience. The interface will be designed to handle the serious, high-stakes nature of legal work while providing a low cognitive load for the user. Our design will adhere to the principle of "Privacy by Design," ensuring that data protection is embedded into the product's core functionality from the very beginning.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Progressive Disclosure:** We will use a progressive disclosure architecture to prevent users from being overwhelmed with information. The interface will show only the most relevant information first, such as a high-level risk assessment (e.g., Red, Amber, Green, or "RAG" status). Users can then "drill down" into specific details, such as the problematic clause, the legal principle behind the finding, and the recommended action.
* **Explainable AI:** The interface will be designed to make the AI's logic transparent. For every finding, the system will provide a clear explanation of the legal concept that was applied and provide an auditable link to the source. This directly addresses the fear of AI "hallucinations" and builds trust with a professional audience.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** The interface will be designed to support human intervention and review. Users will be able to easily navigate, edit, and annotate the machine-generated results, and compare them against other documents. The UI will be simple and intuitive, so the user can focus on critical analysis rather than a complex interface.
* **Security and Trust:** The design will prioritize security and privacy from the outset. We will use features like clear dashboards, secure document handling functionalities, and transparent data processing notices to ensure that the user feels confident and safe.

### Core Screens and Views
Based on our discussions and a typical legal tech workflow, the most critical screens and views will include:

* **Document Upload/Intake:** A simple, clean interface for uploading a document, selecting the matter type, and initiating the analysis.
* **Matter Dashboard:** A dashboard that provides a quick overview of a document's status, key risks, and compliance verdicts.
* **Risk Analysis View:** An interactive view of the document with highlighted clauses, an explanations of the risks, and proposed redlines.
* **Report Generation View:** A simple interface for generating, customizing, and downloading the final report.

## 4. GDPR Compliance: Foundational Requirements
### 1. Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Analysis
The Blackletter engine's core functionality will be to analyze a contract to ensure it meets the strict requirements of a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreement (DPA). This is a legally binding contract that is mandatory when a data controller engages a processor to handle personal data. Our system must, at a minimum, verify that the contract addresses the following key points outlined in Article 28(3)(a-h) of the UK GDPR:

* **Documented Instructions (a):** The processor must only process personal data on the documented instructions of the controller.
* **Duty of Confidence (b):** Anyone authorized to process the data must be committed to confidentiality.
* **Security Measures (c):** The processor must implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures in line with Article 32 of the UK GDPR.
* **Sub-processors (d):** The processor must not engage another processor without the controller's prior written authorization.
* **Data Subjects' Rights (e):** The processor must assist the controller in responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights.
* **Assistance with Compliance (f):** The processor must assist the controller in ensuring compliance with obligations such as data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and data breach notifications.
* **End-of-Contract Provisions (g):** The contract must specify that upon termination, the processor will, at the controller's choice, either delete or return all personal data.
* **Audits and Inspections (h):** The processor must make available all necessary information to demonstrate compliance and allow for audits.

The DPO agent will verify that these clauses are present, clear, and compliant. If a clause is missing or problematic, the Blackletter engine will flag it and provide a detailed explanation of the required legal standard, transforming a potential vulnerability into a documented finding.

### 2. Privacy by Design & Default
The platform itself will be built on the principles of Privacy by Design and by Default, as required by the UK GDPR. This is a core, non-negotiable requirement of the project's architecture.

* **Proactive, Not Reactive:** The system will be designed to anticipate and prevent privacy issues before they occur, rather than reacting to them after the fact.
* **Privacy as the Default:** The strictest privacy settings will be applied automatically, ensuring that personal data is protected without any user intervention. This includes data minimization, where only the essential personal data is collected and processed for a specific purpose.
* **End-to-End Security:** Strong security measures, such as encryption and access controls, will be implemented from the beginning and maintained throughout the entire data lifecycle. All data will be processed securely and then destroyed securely when it is no longer needed.
* **Transparency:** The system will be transparent about its functions and data processing activities, ensuring that all actions are independently verifiable and that users can monitor the processing of their data.

## 5. Technical Assumptions
### Deterministic First
* All eight GDPR Art.28(3) detectors will be implemented via rulepacks (YAML/regex) with evidence windows (Â±2 sentences).

## 6. Epic List
### Epic 1: Platform & Core Infrastructure
**Goal:** To build the foundational infrastructure, set up the development environment, and deliver a simple, user-facing document intake process. This epic will result in a fully deployable, albeit limited, version of the application that can receive a document and place it into a queue for processing. This proves the core architecture and user-facing intake process work before we build the complex back-end.

### Epic 2: Blackletter Core Analysis Engine
**Goal:** To implement the core of the Blackletter engine. This includes the deterministic processes for document segmentation, clause extraction, and rule-based risk detection against a basic, sample rulepack. The epic will not yet produce a user-facing report, but it will store the analysis findings, making them available for later display.

### Epic 3: Interactive Risk Dashboard & Reporting
**Goal:** To build the user-facing front end. This epic will create the Pocket Lawyer and Firm-Aware interfaces, including the risk dashboard with verdict chips, the evidence-first UX for findings, and the ability to generate a downloadable PDF/HTML report. This epic delivers the full user experience, making the analysis tangible and actionable.

### Epic 4: GDPR Compliance & Advanced Features
**Goal:** To implement the specialized, high-value compliance features. This includes the full GDPR Art.28(3) detectors, the redline negotiation functionality, and the integration of the "Legal Expert" personas. This epic will transform the platform from a general-purpose tool into a specialized, compliance-first legal suite.

### Epic 5: Production Readiness & Observability
**Goal:** To scale the application for production use. This epic will focus on non-functional requirements such as migrating the database to a production-grade service, implementing a robust background task queue, and setting up comprehensive logging and monitoring to track performance, cost, and system health.
