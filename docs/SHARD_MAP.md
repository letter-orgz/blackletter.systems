# Blackletter — Docs Shard Map

This index lists the shard-ready documents for the Blackletter project and gives a recommended reading order. Add new shards here when created.

## Recommended order

1. `docs/README.md` — **SHARDED** Context Engineering Framework overview and usage guide.
2. `docs/prd/` — **SHARDED** Product Requirements Document (vision, users, scope, acceptance criteria).
3. `docs/shard-ready-arc/` — **SHARDED** Consolidated architecture overview and system-level constraints (high-level reference).
4. `docs/architecture-blackletter/` — **SHARDED** System overview, environments & deployment, technology stack.
5. `docs/backlog-blackletter/` — **SHARDED** Epics, stories, and initial acceptance criteria (MVP backlog - 16 epics E0-E16).
6. `docs/tests-blackletter/` — **SHARDED** Testing strategy, golden fixtures, CI gates.

2. Add an entry to this `SHARD_MAP.md` with a one-line description and suggested place in the reading order.
3. Commit and push; open a PR if the change affects more than documentation (or per your repo rules).
