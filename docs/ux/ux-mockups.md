# UX Mockups

High-fidelity mockups for the dashboard, contract upload flow, and findings interface are available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/blackletter/ux-mockups). These designs complement the wireframes and user flows described in [`ux-specification.md`](./ux-specification.md).

Additional design assets are stored on the shared design drive.
