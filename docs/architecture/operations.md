# Blackletter - Operational Architecture

This document outlines the operational architecture for the Blackletter project, including logging, configuration management, monitoring, and other operational concerns.

## 1. Logging Strategy

### 1.1 Log Levels

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for diagnosing problems, typically only enabled in development
- **INFO**: General operational information about successful operations
- **WARNING**: Events that are unexpected but not necessarily erroneous
- **ERROR**: Errors that prevent a specific operation from completing
- **CRITICAL**: Serious errors that may cause the application to terminate

### 1.2 Log Structure

All logs follow a structured JSON format for easy parsing and analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-26T10:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "backend-api",
  "component": "document-processor",
  "message": "Document processing completed successfully",
  "context": {
    "document_id": "abc123",
    "processing_time_ms": 4500,
    "findings_count": 12
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Log Retention

- **Development**: 7 days
- **Staging**: 30 days
- **Production**: 90 days with archival to long-term storage

## 2. Configuration Management

### 2.1 Configuration Sources

1. **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration that may change between deployments
2. **Configuration Files**: Static configuration that is part of the application
3. **External Configuration Service**: Dynamic configuration that can be updated without deployment

### 2.2 Configuration Hierarchy

```
Default Values → Configuration Files → Environment Variables → External Service
```

### 2.3 Sensitive Configuration

- **Secrets Management**: All secrets (API keys, database passwords) are stored in a secure vault
- **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Rotation**: Automated rotation of secrets with appropriate notification mechanisms

## 3. Monitoring and Observability

### 3.1 Health Checks

- **Liveness Probes**: Determine if the application is running
- **Readiness Probes**: Determine if the application is ready to serve requests
- **Startup Probes**: Determine if the application has started successfully

### 3.2 Metrics Collection

- **Application Metrics**: Custom business metrics (processing time, accuracy rates)
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Dependency Metrics**: Database query performance, external API response times

### 3.3 Distributed Tracing

- **Request Tracing**: End-to-end tracing of user requests through all services
- **Performance Analysis**: Identification of bottlenecks and performance issues
- **Error Tracking**: Correlation of errors across service boundaries

## 4. Alerting and Notification

### 4.1 Alert Categories

- **Critical**: System downtime, data loss, security breaches
- **Warning**: Performance degradation, high error rates, resource exhaustion
- **Info**: Operational events that require attention but are not urgent

### 4.2 Notification Channels

- **PagerDuty**: For critical alerts requiring immediate attention
- **Slack**: For team notifications and collaboration
- **Email**: For non-urgent notifications and reports

### 4.3 Alert Suppression

- **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled suppression during planned maintenance
- **Flapping Detection**: Automatic suppression of rapidly changing alert states
- **Correlation**: Grouping related alerts to reduce noise

## 5. Backup and Disaster Recovery

### 5.1 Data Backup

- **Frequency**: Daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Retention**: 30 days of daily backups, 12 months of monthly backups
- **Storage**: Geographically distributed storage with encryption

### 5.2 Recovery Procedures

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for critical systems
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 24 hours for data
- **Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery drills

## 6. Deployment and Release Management

### 6.1 Deployment Pipeline

1. **Development**: Feature branches with automated testing
2. **Staging**: Pre-production environment for integration testing
3. **Production**: Live environment with gradual rollout capabilities

### 6.2 Release Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to a subset of users
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime control of feature availability

### 6.3 Rollback Procedures

- **Automated Rollback**: Automatic rollback on critical errors
- **Manual Rollback**: Quick manual rollback capability
- **Data Rollback**: Database migration rollback procedures

## 7. Capacity Planning

### 7.1 Resource Monitoring

- **CPU Utilization**: Target <70% average, <85% peak
- **Memory Usage**: Target <75% average, <90% peak
- **Disk Space**: Target <80% usage with automatic alerts
- **Network Bandwidth**: Target <70% utilization

### 7.2 Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances to handle increased load
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources for existing instances
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic adjustment based on metrics

## 8. Maintenance Procedures

### 8.1 Scheduled Maintenance

- **Database Maintenance**: Weekly maintenance windows for optimization
- **Security Updates**: Regular patching of system components
- **Dependency Updates**: Monthly updates of third-party libraries

### 8.2 Unscheduled Maintenance

- **Emergency Patches**: Immediate deployment for critical security issues
- **Incident Response**: Rapid response to system failures
- **Performance Tuning**: Ongoing optimization based on monitoring data

## 9. Operational Runbooks

### 9.1 Common Operational Tasks

- **Service Restart**: Procedures for restarting services with minimal impact
- **Configuration Updates**: Safe methods for updating configuration values
- **Data Migration**: Processes for migrating data between systems

### 9.2 Troubleshooting Guides

- **Performance Issues**: Diagnosis and resolution of performance problems
- **Error Conditions**: Identification and resolution of common error states
- **Integration Failures**: Troubleshooting of external service integrations

## 10. Compliance and Auditing

### 10.1 Audit Logging

- **User Actions**: Logging of all user activities with timestamps
- **System Changes**: Recording of all configuration and code changes
- **Security Events**: Detailed logging of security-related activities

### 10.2 Compliance Reporting

- **Regular Reports**: Automated generation of compliance status reports
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit trails for regulatory requirements
- **Third-party Audits**: Support for external compliance audits
