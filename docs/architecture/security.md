# Blackletter - Security Architecture

This document outlines the security architecture for the Blackletter project, including threat models, security controls, and compliance considerations.

## 1. Security Principles

- **Privacy by Design**: Data protection and privacy considerations are integrated into every aspect of the system
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls throughout the technology stack
- **Least Privilege**: Users and systems have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions
- **Secure by Default**: Security controls are enabled by default with secure configurations

## 2. Threat Model

### 2.1 STRIDE Analysis

| Threat Type | Description | Mitigation |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Unauthorized users attempting to access the system | Authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys), rate limiting |
| **Tampering** | Modification of data in transit or at rest | Encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256), integrity checks |
| **Repudiation** | Users denying actions they performed | Comprehensive audit logging, non-repudiation controls |
| **Information Disclosure** | Unauthorized access to sensitive data | Access controls, encryption, data minimization |
| **Denial of Service** | Overwhelming the system to make it unavailable | Rate limiting, resource quotas, auto-scaling |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Unauthorized access to administrative functions | Role-based access control, privilege separation |

### 2.2 Key Assets

1. **Uploaded Contracts**: Sensitive legal documents containing potentially confidential information
2. **Processing Results**: Findings and analysis data that could reveal business information
3. **User Accounts**: Authentication credentials and access tokens
4. **System Configuration**: API keys, database credentials, and other secrets

## 3. Security Controls

### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization

- **User Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration with single sign-on providers
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration times
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: API keys with limited scope and permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Reviewer, and Auditor roles with appropriate permissions

### 3.2 Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is processed and stored
- **Automatic Data Deletion**: Configurable retention policies with automatic enforcement

### 3.3 Network Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive inbound and outbound traffic rules
- **Private Networks**: Isolation of database and internal services
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic filtering
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious activities

### 3.4 Application Security

- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Prevention of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security-focused HTTP headers

## 4. Compliance Considerations

### 4.1 GDPR Compliance

- **Data Processing Agreements**: Standard contracts with subprocessors
- **Data Subject Rights**: Mechanisms for data access, rectification, and deletion
- **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Regular assessments of privacy risks
- **Data Protection Officer**: Designation of responsible personnel

### 4.2 SOC 2 Compliance

- **Security**: Protection of system resources against unauthorized access
- **Availability**: System operation and accessibility as committed or agreed
- **Processing Integrity**: System processing that is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized
- **Confidentiality**: Protection of information designated as confidential
- **Privacy**: Protection of personal information

## 5. Incident Response

### 5.1 Detection and Monitoring

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized log collection and analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated scanning for known vulnerabilities

### 5.2 Response Procedures

- **Incident Classification**: Categorization based on impact and severity
- **Communication Plan**: Notification procedures for stakeholders and authorities
- **Containment Strategy**: Isolation of affected systems to prevent further damage
- **Recovery Process**: Restoration of services with verification of integrity

### 5.3 Post-Incident Activities

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Determination of underlying causes
- **Lessons Learned**: Documentation of findings and improvements
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance with breach notification requirements

## 6. Security Testing

### 6.1 Automated Testing

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Code analysis during development
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime vulnerability scanning
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Identification of vulnerable dependencies

### 6.2 Manual Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments
- **Security Code Reviews**: Manual review of critical security controls
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular updates to threat models and mitigations

## 7. Security Operations

### 7.1 Monitoring and Logging

- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all user and system activities
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events
- **Log Retention**: Secure storage of logs for compliance and investigation

### 7.2 Configuration Management

- **Secure Baselines**: Hardened configurations for all system components
- **Change Control**: Controlled process for security-related changes
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Automated detection of unauthorized changes

## 8. Training and Awareness

- **Developer Training**: Regular security training for engineering teams
- **Security Champions**: Designated security advocates within development teams
- **Incident Response Training**: Regular drills and simulations
