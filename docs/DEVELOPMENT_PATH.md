# Development Path

This repository focuses active development under the `apps/` directory.

- `apps/api/main.py` – FastAPI entry point
- `apps/api/blackletter_api/` – Backend implementation
- `apps/web/` – Next.js frontend
- `docs/` – Architecture and story documentation for current work
- `docs/legacy/` – Archived documents and experiments

New features and fixes should target the modules under `apps/` and keep documentation in `docs/`.
