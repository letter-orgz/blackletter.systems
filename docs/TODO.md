# BMAD Blackletter — TODO

## Demo (Mock) — Ready to pick
- [ ] 0.0 Demo Mock Flow: add `/reports` page stub + wire ExportDialog confirm → mock store → navigate to /reports.
- [ ] Findings A11y pass: verify ESC behavior and focus trap for drawer & dialog; aria-labels on verdict chips.
- [ ] README: document Demo mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1), routes, limitations.

## Independent UI polish (no backend)
- [ ] Copy-to-clipboard toast in Evidence Drawer (non-blocking).
- [ ] Small-screen responsive tweaks for table & drawer.
