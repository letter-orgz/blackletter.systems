    *   **Core Statement:** Primitive purpose is to answer a narrowly framed legal question with a binary/ternary outcome and minimal defensible evidence.
    *   **Inputs (irreducible):** Authority set (A), Artifact to test (D), Question (Q).
    *   **Output (irreducible):** Answer (Yes/No/Unknown), Evidence, Citation, Trace (optional).
    *   **Axioms:** Verifiability, Locality, Determinism first, Three-valued logic, Monotonicity, Cost minimality, Auditability.
    *   **Primitive Data Types:** Rule, Match, Claim, Coverage, Trace.

### Five Whys

*   **Problem Explored:** Why are we making too many / too large LLM calls?
*   **Root Cause Identified:** The absence of architectural and operational cost guardrails and early-warning metrics, which allowed the path of least resistance (over-reliance on LLMs) to persist without friction.

### SCAMPER

#### Substitute

*   **Ideas Generated:** Whole-document prompts → snippet-only; many LLM checks → rules + confidence gates; cloud LLMs for borderline cases → local tiny models/classifier; ad-hoc prompts → compact, templated prompts; synchronous LLM calls → batched/async verification; no caching → deterministic response cache; heavy OCR → prefer native text extraction; exploratory LLM use → token ledger + hard caps; cloud provider lock-in → provider-agnostic LLM wrapper.

#### Combine

*   **Ideas Generated:** Rules + Snippet-only + LLM-gate + Token-ledger; Local classifier + Rulepack hybrids + LLM fallback; Caching + Prompt-ID registry + Batch verify; Header-aware chunking + Template anchors + Heuristic boosting; Evidence-first UI + Explainability + Dispute feedback loop; OCR fallback + quality-gate; Local "exemplar library" + side-by-side rewrite suggestions; Metered hosted demo + self-host option.
*   **Integrated "Combo Stack":** Ingestion, Rules Engine, Local Classifier, LLM Gate, Cache & Registry, UI, Ops, Export & Privacy.

#### Adapt

*   **Ideas Generated:** Search-engine indexing → inverted index for clause lookup; Static analysis/linters → rulepacks + auto-fix suggestions; E-discovery sampling → focused review queue; Anti-fraud/Spam systems → lightweight feature hashing + local classifier; CDN/caching → snippet/result cache with TTL; Canary releases/feature flags; Observability & budgets; Knowledge distillation; Human-in-the-loop; Fuzzy matching; Incremental processing/streaming; Template libraries.

## Action Planning

Based on our discussions, particularly the "Immediate Opportunities" and the "Blue Hat" plan, here's a proposed action plan to kickstart the development of your blackletter system:

### Top 3 Priority Ideas (from Immediate Opportunities)

1.  **Lock LLM off by default & enforce snippet-only prompts:** This is the most critical step for immediate cost control and aligns with the rules-first principle. It directly addresses the root cause identified in the Five Whys.
    *   **Rationale:** Prevents accidental cloud spend, forces reliance on free deterministic rules, and significantly cuts token usage.
2.  **Add token-ledger stub + hard cap enforcement & Implement local SQLite cache:** These two combined provide immediate visibility and control over costs, and make repeated operations free.
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for predictable budgeting and maximizing the value of each LLM call (when enabled).
3.  **Build header-aware snippet extractor & Create YAML rulepack stubs:** These are foundational for the rules-first approach, enabling precise and free analysis.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves the accuracy of deterministic rules, reduces the need for LLM calls, and provides the core logic for the system.

### Next Steps for Each Priority

1.  **For LLM Control:**
    *   Set `LLM_PROVIDER="none"` as a default environment variable.
    *   Modify all LLM invocation points to check `LLM_PROVIDER` and skip calls if "none".
    *   Refactor any existing LLM calls to ensure only snippets (not whole documents) are sent.
2.  **For Cost Tracking & Caching:**
    *   Implement the `token_ledger.py` wrapper to log estimated and actual token usage.
    *   Create the SQLite `cache` table and integrate lookup/insert logic into your `llm_client`.
    *   Define and enforce a `max_tokens_per_doc` in your configuration.
3.  **For Core Logic:**
    *   Develop the `get_best_snippet()` function in your extractor to accurately identify and return header-aware paragraphs with offsets.
    *   Begin populating `analyzer/rules/processor_obligations.yaml` with initial `id`, `must_include`, `weak`, and `evidence_window` definitions for the 8 Art. 28(3) detectors.

### Resources/Research Needed

*   **Technical:** Python development environment (already set up), `pypdf`, `python-docx`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pytest`, `sqlite-utils`.
*   **Data:** Public GDPR processor agreements for gold set creation.
*   **Knowledge:** Deep understanding of GDPR Art. 28(3) and related ICO guidance for rule definition.

### Timeline Considerations

*   **Immediate (Next 48-72 hours):** Focus on completing the "Next Steps for Each Priority" outlined above. This aligns with the Day 1-3 activities from the "Seven-Day Build Plan" in the Blue Hat.
*   **Short-term (Next 1-2 weeks):** Complete the remaining "Immediate Opportunities" (Gold Set v1, metrics page, conservative verdict, disable OCR, batch queue, local classifier prototype, exemplar templates).
*   **Mid-term (1-6 months):** Begin tackling "Future Innovations" from Priority A and B, focusing on auto-updating knowledge, human-in-loop, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Reflection & Follow-up

This brainstorming session was highly productive, generating a wealth of ideas from foundational principles to ambitious moonshots, all while maintaining a strong focus on cost-effectiveness. The structured approach of the Six Thinking Hats and SCAMPER method proved invaluable in exploring diverse perspectives and breaking down complex challenges into actionable components.

*   **What worked well:** The systematic progression through the hats and SCAMPER elements ensured comprehensive coverage. Your detailed contributions at each stage were exceptional, providing rich content for analysis and planning. The focus on "ideally free" consistently guided our ideation.
*   **Areas for further exploration:** As we move into implementation, we may need to revisit specific technical details for each "Immediate Opportunity" to ensure smooth integration. Further deep dives into the "Future Innovations" and "Moonshots" will be necessary as the MVP evolves.
*   **Recommended follow-up techniques:** Once the initial implementation is underway, techniques like "Root Cause Analysis" (if new problems arise) or "Decision Matrix" (for choosing between complex alternatives) could be useful.
*   **Questions that emerged for future sessions:** How will we continuously refine the deterministic rules? What is the exact process for human-in-loop feedback to improve the system? How will we measure the "value" of each feature beyond just cost savings?

This document serves as a comprehensive record of our brainstorming and a solid foundation for your project.
