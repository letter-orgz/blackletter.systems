# 1. Goals and Background Context
**Goals:**

* To provide an accessible and affordable legal triage service for individuals and small businesses.
* To deliver a compliance-first, AI-powered tool that automates legal review and risk assessment for law firms.
* To establish the Blackletter engine as a trusted and auditable source of legal intelligence, reducing the risk of "hallucinations".
* To capture a significant share of the growing UK legal technology market, which has an estimated annual market opportunity of Â£22 billion in the UK alone.

**Background Context:**

The UK legal market is facing a dual problem: an access-to-justice gap for consumers and a need for greater efficiency and compliance for law firms. Our unified platform, powered by the Blackletter engine, directly addresses this dual problem by providing a single, seamless solution. This approach is backed by market research showing strong demand for AI-driven solutions and a clear gap in the market for a compliance-first tool.
