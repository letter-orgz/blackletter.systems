# 1) Vision & Goals
**Vision**: Shrink vendor‑contract GDPR review from hours to minutes with **explainable, deterministic checks** against **GDPR Art. 28(3)**, each backed by pinpoint citations and clear rationale.

**Primary Goals (MVP)**
- Deliver **8 obligation checks** from Art. 28(3)(a)–(h) with **Pass / Weak / Missing / Needs review** verdicts.  
- Show **why** for every finding (rule id + snippet + location).  
- **Exportable report** (PDF/HTML) suitable for sharing internally/with vendors.  
- Operate with **low cost** and **tight latency** at small scale.

**Non‑Goals (MVP)**
- Automated redlining or clause rewriting.  
- Multi‑jurisdictional beyond UK/EU GDPR.  
- Batch processing, collaboration, or workflow automation.
