# 3. User Interface Design Goals
## Overall UX Vision
The core UX vision is to transform the complex and often intimidating process of legal analysis into a clear, trustworthy, and efficient experience. The interface will be designed to handle the serious, high-stakes nature of legal work while providing a low cognitive load for the user. Our design will adhere to the principle of "Privacy by Design," ensuring that data protection is embedded into the product's core functionality from the very beginning.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Progressive Disclosure:** We will use a progressive disclosure architecture to prevent users from being overwhelmed with information. The interface will show only the most relevant information first, such as a high-level risk assessment (e.g., Red, Amber, Green, or "RAG" status). Users can then "drill down" into specific details, such as the problematic clause, the legal principle behind the finding, and the recommended action.
* **Explainable AI:** The interface will be designed to make the AI's logic transparent. For every finding, the system will provide a clear explanation of the legal concept that was applied and provide an auditable link to the source. This directly addresses the fear of AI "hallucinations" and builds trust with a professional audience.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** The interface will be designed to support human intervention and review. Users will be able to easily navigate, edit, and annotate the machine-generated results, and compare them against other documents. The UI will be simple and intuitive, so the user can focus on critical analysis rather than a complex interface.
* **Security and Trust:** The design will prioritize security and privacy from the outset. We will use features like clear dashboards, secure document handling functionalities, and transparent data processing notices to ensure that the user feels confident and safe.

## Core Screens and Views
Based on our discussions and a typical legal tech workflow, the most critical screens and views will include:

* **Document Upload/Intake:** A simple, clean interface for uploading a document, selecting the matter type, and initiating the analysis.
* **Matter Dashboard:** A dashboard that provides a quick overview of a document's status, key risks, and compliance verdicts.
* **Risk Analysis View:** An interactive view of the document with highlighted clauses, an explanations of the risks, and proposed redlines.
* **Report Generation View:** A simple interface for generating, customizing, and downloading the final report.
