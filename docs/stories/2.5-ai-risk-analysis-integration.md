# Story 2.5: AI Risk Analysis Integration

## Overview

**As a** compliance officer or contract reviewer,  
**I want** a comprehensive AI-powered risk dashboard that analyzes contracts beyond basic GDPR compliance,  
**so that** I can identify financial, operational, reputational, and legal risks before contract execution.

## Status

Draft

## Story

This story introduces a comprehensive AI-powered risk dashboard that extends the existing GDPR compliance checking capabilities to provide multi-dimensional contract risk analysis. The system will analyze contracts across 5 key risk categories, generating detailed scores, evidence snippets, and actionable recommendations for each. This advancement transforms the tool from a basic compliance checker into a full-fledged contract risk intelligence platform.

Key features include:
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring (Compliance, Financial, Operational, Reputational, Legal)
- Interactive risk dashboard with heat maps and factor breakdowns
- Evidence-based recommendations for risk mitigation
- Automated risk alerts for critical findings
- Configurable risk thresholds and alerting rules
- Exportable risk reports with executive summaries
- Integration with existing GDPR compliance findings
- Performance benchmarks ensuring analysis completion within 30 seconds

The implementation will involve extending the existing `ai_risk_scorer.py` service with new API endpoints, developing new frontend components for the risk dashboard, and integrating this functionality into the detector runner pipeline. Risk profiles will be stored alongside existing analysis data, and the system will integrate with the token ledger for AI usage monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system must generate a comprehensive risk score across 5 categories: Compliance (35%), Financial (25%), Operational (20%), Reputational (15%), Legal (5%).
- [ ] The risk dashboard must display an overall risk level (Low/Medium/High/Critical) and a heat map visualization of risk factors.
- [ ] For each risk category, the system must provide a detailed breakdown with evidence snippets from the contract and specific recommendations for mitigation.
- [ ] The system must support automated risk alerts for findings that exceed configurable thresholds.
- [ ] Users must be able to configure risk thresholds and alerting rules for different risk categories.
- [ ] Risk analysis reports must be exportable in a standard format (e.g., PDF) with an executive summary.
- [ ] The entire risk analysis process, from contract upload to dashboard display, must complete within 30 seconds.
- [ ] All new functionality must be fully integrated with the existing detector runner pipeline and analysis data storage.

## Tasks

### Backend Implementation

- [ ] Extend `ai_risk_scorer.py` to calculate scores for Financial, Operational, Reputational, and Legal risk categories.
- [ ] Create new API endpoints for retrieving risk profiles and configuring alert thresholds.
- [ ] Integrate risk scoring into the detector runner pipeline after findings generation.
- [ ] Implement storage for risk profiles alongside existing analysis data.
- [ ] Add token usage tracking for risk analysis to the token ledger.

### Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Design and implement the interactive risk dashboard layout.
- [ ] Create reusable components for the risk heat map and risk factor cards.
- [ ] Implement the risk factor detail view with evidence snippets and recommendations.
- [ ] Develop the risk alert configuration interface.
- [ ] Implement the risk report export functionality.

### Integration and Testing

- [ ] Ensure seamless integration between the new risk scoring service and the frontend dashboard.
- [ ] Conduct unit tests for all new backend services and API endpoints.
- [ ] Perform integration testing to verify the end-to-end risk analysis workflow.
- [ ] Execute performance testing to validate the 30-second analysis benchmark.
- [ ] Update documentation for the new risk analysis features and API endpoints.

## Dev Notes

The existing `ai_risk_scorer.py` service provides a solid foundation for this work, as it already handles the basic structure of AI-powered contract analysis. The main challenge will be defining the prompts and logic for scoring the new risk categories. We should leverage the existing detector framework and findings model to store and manage the new risk data. Consideration should also be given to the user experience of the dashboard, ensuring it is intuitive and provides clear value to the user.

## Testing

- Unit tests for new risk scoring logic in `ai_risk_scorer.py`.
- Integration tests for the new API endpoints.
- End-to-end tests for the risk analysis workflow in the detector runner.
- Performance tests to ensure analysis completes within 30 seconds.
- UI tests for the new risk dashboard components.
