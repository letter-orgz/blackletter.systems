**ID**: 0.1
**Epic**: 1  Ingestion (Demo)
**Status**: **Approved**
**Goal**: Simulate the Upload ��' Job Status flow entirely on the client, with a visible stepper and a CTA to open the seeded mock analysis, no backend.

## Context

- Route: `/new` (Upload page).
- Env gate: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1` to enable deterministic UI mocks.
- No backend required: All states are driven by a timer and client state.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `/new` renders a drag�?'and�?'drop area and a file picker.
2. After selecting/dropping a file, a stepper shows: Queued ��' Extracting ��' Detecting ��' Reporting ��' Done.
3. On Done, a primary CTA appears: �?oView Findings�?? linking to `/analyses/mock-1`.
4. A secondary action allows �?oStart over�?? to reset the UI.
5. Accessibility: keyboard navigable controls; visible focus; ESC to cancel upload simulation; ARIA labels on stepper states.
6. Toggle: Unsetting `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` should still render the page without errors (no API calls made in this story).

## Interfaces (no new APIs)

- None. Pure frontend simulation gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1`.

## Tasks

**proposed_tasks**

- [x] Create `/new` page with drag'and'drop (or button) and a simple progress stepper component.
- [x] Implement a timed state machine (e.g., ~0.9s per state under mocks) cycling Queued -> Extracting -> Detecting -> Reporting -> Done.
- [x] On Done, show "View Findings" linking to `/analyses/mock-1`, and a "Start over" reset action.
- [x] Add ESC handler to cancel/reset simulation; ensure focus ring and ARIA labels for stepper.
- [ ] Add light unit coverage for the state machine (advance, cancel, reset).

**agent_model_used**

- dev

**file_list**

- apps/web/src/app/new/page.tsx (client-side upload simulation, stepper, ESC cancel)

**change_log**

- feat(web): add `/new` mock upload + stepper

**completion_notes**

- Page renders without backend; ESC cancels; CTA links to `/analyses/mock-1`.

**decisions**

- Keep scope UI�?'only under `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` to avoid coupling with 1.1/1.2.
- Step durations: fixed vs. random within a small range (recommend slight jitter for natural feel).

**notes**

- When later wiring real upload, guard the simulation behind the env flag to avoid conflicts.
