# Validation Report for Story 0.0: Demo Mock Contract Flow

## 1. Template Compliance Issues

- **Missing Sections**: The story is missing the following sections as defined in the template:
    -   `Testing` (sub-section under Dev Notes)
    -   `Change Log` table columns are present but not fully populated (missing Author for the initial entry).
    -   `Dev Agent Record` section (This is expected as it's for the dev agent to populate).
    -   `QA Results` section (This is expected as it's for the QA agent to populate).
- **Unfilled Placeholders**: No unfilled placeholders like `{{EpicNum}}` or `_TBD_` were found in the main content.
- **Structure Compliance**: The story largely follows the structure defined in `story-tmpl.yaml`, although it's in Markdown format, not YAML. The core sections (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Tasks/Subtasks, Change Log) are present.

## 2. Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- **Missing "Testing" Sub-Section**: The `Dev Notes` section is missing the required `Testing` sub-section as specified by the template and the `validate-next-story` task. The story currently has a "Testing Requirements" entry within `Dev Notes`, but the template explicitly asks for a `Testing` sub-section.
- **Incomplete "Change Log" Entry**: The initial entry in the `Change Log` lacks an "Author". While minor, the template specifies the columns.
- **Incomplete Acceptance Criteria Coverage in Tasks (AC: 7)**: Acceptance Criterion 7 ("Toggle: Unsetting `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` makes the UI fall back to the API stubs without errors.") is not directly mapped to a specific task. Task "Frontend: Toggle" (AC: 7) only covers part of it ("Ensure unsetting ... without errors"), but the "fall back to API stubs" part is implicit and could be clearer.
- **Vague Task Description (AC: 5)**: The task "Frontend: Reports (stub) - Add `/reports` page..." does not explicitly state *how* the mock store is implemented (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, in-memory). The AC mentions "local mock store", so the task should ideally reflect this more precisely.

## 3. Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- **Explicit Mention of A11y Testing Tools**: While the Dev Notes mention A11y testing ("Keyboard access (TAB/SHIFT+TAB), ESC on drawer/dialog..."), it doesn't explicitly name the tools that will be used (e.g., Axe-core, Lighthouse) as per standard testing practices in this project (`docs/architecture/10-quality-gates-testing.md` mentions Playwright for E2E, which could cover this).
- **Clarify "API stubs"**: The term "API stubs" in AC 7 and the corresponding task could be slightly more specific. Does it mean the existing `react-query` hooks that would normally fetch real data will have a mock/fallback mechanism, or is there another stubbing approach?
- **Dependency on `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS`**: The story is entirely dependent on this environment variable. It might be beneficial to explicitly call out potential testing complexities this introduces (e.g., needing to run tests in both modes).

## 4. Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- **Estimation Guidance**: The tasks are well-defined, but adding rough estimation points (e.g., story points or time) could help in sprint planning.
- **Definition of Done**: Explicitly stating the Definition of Done criteria for this story, derived from the ACs, could add clarity.
- **Link to Mock Data Source**: While `mocks.ts` is mentioned, linking to or briefly describing the structure of the mock data (e.g., how the 8 detectors are defined) could provide even more context.

## 5. Anti-Hallucination Findings

- **Source Verification**: All technical claims in the `Dev Notes` (File Locations, Data Models, API Specs, Component Specs, Testing Requirements, Technical Constraints) are correctly attributed to specific architecture documents (e.g., `docs/architecture/5-data-model-pydantic.md`, `docs/architecture/source_tree.md`).
- **Architecture Alignment**: The content in `Dev Notes` accurately reflects the specifications from the referenced architecture documents.
- **No Invented Details**: No libraries, patterns, or standards were invented. Everything aligns with the documented tech stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Playwright, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier).
- **Reference Accuracy**: All source references appear to be correct and point to existing documents.

## 6. Final Assessment

- **GO/NO-GO**: **NO-GO** (Requires fixes before implementation due to Critical Issues).
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: **7/10**. The story is well-structured and has good detail, but it's missing a required section and has slightly ambiguous task mappings.
- **Confidence Level**: **High** for successful implementation *after* the critical issues are addressed. The provided context is sufficient for a developer to understand the requirements and technical approach.

### Summary of Required Changes

1.  Add the missing `Testing` sub-section under `Dev Notes`.
2.  Clarify the task for AC 7 to explicitly cover the "fall back to API stubs" functionality.
3.  Specify the type of "local mock store" in the task for AC 5.
