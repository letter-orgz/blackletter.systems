title: Detector Runner (verdict + evidence)
status: draft
story: |
  As a detection system, I need to run the loaded detectors against the extracted text evidence windows to produce findings with verdicts and supporting snippets.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Evaluate anchors/weak/red‑flags within evidence window
  - Produce verdict per mapping; attach rule id + snippet + offsets
  - Unit tests: 3 positive + 3 hard negative per detector (a)–(c) to start
notes:
  - Integrate with the rulepack loader (Story 2.1) to get the detectors.
  - Integrate with the evidence window builder (Story 1.3) to get the text context.
  - Findings should be persisted linked to the analysis.
  - Verdict mapping logic needs to be clearly defined.

  proposed_tasks:
    - backend: Implement detector evaluation (anchors_any/all, weak, redflags) over evidence windows
    - backend: Verdict mapping function -> pass|weak|missing|needs_review, attach rule_id + offsets
    - storage: Persist Finding[] linked to analysis id
    - tests: 3 pos + 3 hard neg per detector (a)-(c); offset correctness; mapping coverage
