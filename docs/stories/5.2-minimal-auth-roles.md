title: Minimal Auth & Roles
status: draft
story: |
  As a system, I need to enforce role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions like uploading files, changing settings, or exporting reports.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Admin can manage settings; Reviewer can upload/export only
  - Sessions persisted; CSRF protected
notes:
  - Define the permissions for Admin and Reviewer roles.
  - Integration with the frontend UI to show/hide features.
  - Backend middleware to check permissions on API endpoints.
  - Session management and CSRF protection are crucial for web security.
  - For MVP, this might be a simple implementation, potentially using basic auth or a library.

  merge_note:
    - Consolidates duplicate auth UI story (was 1.2-user-authentication-setup.md) into this story
  proposed_tasks:
    - backend: Session-cookie auth with role claims; CSRF protection
    - backend: Guard /api/admin/* and settings/report mutations by role
    - frontend: Login/logout UI; route protection; role-based nav
    - tests: Auth happy/negative; role enforcement; CSRF
  open_decisions:
    - Supabase Auth vs. session-cookie per architecture (recommend session-cookie per arch)
    - Passwordless/email magic link vs. basic email+password for MVP
