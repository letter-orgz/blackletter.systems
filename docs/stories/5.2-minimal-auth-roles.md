title: Minimal Auth & Roles
status: draft
story: |
  As a system, I need to enforce role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions like uploading files, changing settings, or exporting reports.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Admin can manage settings; Reviewer can upload/export only
  - Sessions persisted; CSRF protected
notes:
  - Define the permissions for Admin and Reviewer roles.
  - Integration with the frontend UI to show/hide features.
  - Backend middleware to check permissions on API endpoints.
  - Session management and CSRF protection are crucial for web security.
  - For MVP, this might be a simple implementation, potentially using basic auth or a library.
