## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary
   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:
   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)
   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work down and not create a mess.]]

- Major gaps identified: None

This story is well-defined and provides clear guidance for a developer to implement a frontend mock demo. All acceptance criteria are testable, and the necessary technical details, file locations, and references are included.

As a developer, I could implement this story as written. My main questions would be around the specific implementation details of the mock data structures and whether there are any existing components in the codebase that could be reused for the dashboard, findings table, evidence drawer, and export dialog. Potential delays might occur if there are unexpected complexities in implementing the keyboard accessibility features or if the existing frontend architecture requires significant adjustments to accommodate the mock mode toggle.
