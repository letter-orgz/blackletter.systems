title: Coverage Meter
status: draft
story: |
  As an administrator or reviewer, I want to see a visual representation of how well the rulepack covers the analyzed documents so that I can understand the completeness of the analysis.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Visual shows detector coverage per doc
  - Warning if any detector returns unknown
notes:
  - Likely a component on the analysis results page or a separate admin view.
  - Data source is the findings generated by the detector runner (Story 2.2).
  - Define what 'coverage' and 'unknown' mean in this context.
  - Visualization could be a simple bar chart or heatmap.

    - backend: Compute detector coverage per analysis from findings data
