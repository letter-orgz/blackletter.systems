title: Evidence Window Builder (±2 sentences)
status: draft
story: |
  As a detection system, I need to build evidence windows around findings so that reviewers can see the context of a detected issue within the contract text.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Given a char span, return ±2 sentences (configurable per detector)
  - Respect sentence boundaries; avoid cross‑page leakage
  - Unit tests with synthetic spans
notes:
  - Use the sentence index created in Story 1.2.
  - Need to handle edge cases like spans near the beginning or end of the document.
  - Configuration for sentence window size should be considered.
