title: Weak‑Language Lexicon v0
status: draft
story: |
  As a detection system, I need to apply a lexicon of weak language terms to findings to potentially downgrade a 'Pass' verdict to 'Weak' if no strong counter-anchors are found.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Apply lexicon inside evidence window
  - Downgrade Pass→Weak unless counter‑anchor present
  - Configurable lexicon file
notes:
  - Depends on the Detector Runner (Story 2.2) producing initial verdicts.
  - Lexicon file format needs to be defined (likely YAML).
  - Counter-anchor logic needs definition.
  - This is a post-processing step for findings.
