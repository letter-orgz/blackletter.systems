title: Org Settings (LLM/OCR/Retention)
status: draft
story: |
  As an administrator, I want to configure organization-level settings for LLM provider, OCR enablement, and data retention so that I can control costs, features, and compliance.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Toggle LLM provider (none/default), OCR, retention policy
  - Persist securely; defaults conservative
  - Audit log for settings changes
notes:
  - Settings should be loaded at application startup and potentially reloadable.
  - Secure persistence likely means environment variables or a secure configuration store.
  - Retention policy defines how long analysis data/files are kept.
  - Audit logging should capture who changed what and when.
