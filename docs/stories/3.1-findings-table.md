title: Findings Table (evidenceâ€‘first)
status: draft
story: |
  As a reviewer, I want to see a table of findings for an analyzed contract so that I can quickly understand which GDPR Article 28 clauses might be missing or weak.
acceptance_criteria:
  - 8 detector rows with verdict color and short rationale
  - Detail drawer shows snippet + rule id + copy button
  - Filter by verdict; search within snippets
notes:
  - Frontend component, likely using a table library (e.g., TanStack Table).
  - Verdict colors: pass (green), weak (yellow), missing (red), needs_review (orange).
  - Detail drawer should be accessible via click or expand icon.
  - Filtering and search should be client-side for MVP.

  impl_notes:
    - Mock-driven UI scaffolding added under apps/web: table, drawer, verdict chips, empty-state text
    - Toggle mocks via NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=1; falls back to API stubs otherwise
    - Local-only 'Reviewed' badge toggle in drawer for UX validation
