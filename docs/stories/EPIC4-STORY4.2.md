### Story Description

As a Developer or QA Engineer, I want a comprehensive coverage meter so that I can track and visualize the effectiveness of our testing and analysis capabilities. This includes test coverage for our codebase, code coverage for our analysis pipeline, and rule coverage for our detection engine. The goal is to have a clear, measurable understanding of our quality and risk posture.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Test Coverage Tracking:**
    - The system must collect and aggregate test coverage data (e.g., from pytest-cov) from CI/CD runs.
    - Coverage data should be stored historically to track trends.
    - A UI component must display the current overall test coverage percentage.

2.  **Code Coverage Visualization:**
    - The system must integrate with a code coverage tool (like Codecov, Coveralls, or a built-in solution).
    - The UI must provide a way to visualize code coverage, highlighting lines/files that are not covered by tests.
    - Coverage reports should be accessible for each CI/CD build.

3.  **Rule Coverage for Detection Engine:**
    - A mechanism must be implemented to track which detection rules are covered by test cases (e.g., in `tests/rules/`).
    - The coverage meter must display the percentage of detection rules that have at least one corresponding test.
    - A report should be generated listing all untested detection rules.

4.  **Trends and Quality Gates:**
    - The dashboard must show trends for all three coverage types (test, code, rule) over time.
    - Quality gates must be implemented in the CI/CD pipeline.
    - A build should fail if coverage drops below a configurable threshold (e.g., drops by more than 2% or falls below 80%).

### Technical Implementation Guidance

-   **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
    -   Create new API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/quality/coverage`) to serve coverage data.
    -   Integrate `pytest-cov` to generate coverage reports in a machine-readable format (e.g., `coverage.json` or `coverage.xml`).
    -   Write a parser to process the coverage reports and store the summary data in the database (e.g., PostgreSQL or a time-series DB like InfluxDB).
    -   For rule coverage, the script should scan the `rulepacks/` directory and the `tests/rules/` directory, matching rules to tests by a naming convention or metadata.

-   **Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript):**
    -   Develop a new page or dashboard widget for the "Coverage Meter".
    -   Use a charting library (e.g., Recharts or Chart.js) to display coverage trends.
    -   Implement components to show percentage gauges for each coverage type.
    -   Consider using a library to render file-level coverage reports if building a custom solution.

-   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
    -   Modify the existing CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
    -   Add a step to run tests with coverage enabled and upload the coverage report as a build artifact.
    -   Add a subsequent step that runs a script to analyze the report and enforce the quality gate.
    -   If using a third-party service like Codecov, add the `codecov-action` to the workflow.

### Testing Requirements

-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Test the backend API endpoints for fetching coverage data.
    -   Test the coverage report parser to ensure it handles various formats correctly.
    -   Test the rule coverage calculation logic.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Verify that the CI/CD pipeline correctly generates, uploads, and processes coverage reports.
    -   Test the quality gate logic by creating a PR that intentionally lowers coverage.
-   **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
    -   Create a test that navigates to the coverage meter page.
    -   Verify that the coverage widgets display the expected data (can use mock data for consistency).
    -   Test the navigation to detailed coverage reports.
