      **As a** System Administrator,
      **I want** a real-time metrics display system with performance monitoring and alerting capabilities,
      **so that** I can have a comprehensive overview of the system's health, performance, and costs.

      1. A dedicated, real-time metrics dashboard page is available.
      2. The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) with visual charts and graphs.
      3. Performance monitoring for API endpoints is implemented, tracking metrics like p95 latency.
      4. The system includes an alerting mechanism for critical system health events (e.g., high error rates, latency spikes).
      5. Metrics for the document processing pipeline are tracked, including `tokens_per_doc` and the percentage of documents invoking LLMs.
      6. An "explainability rate" is displayed, showing the percentage of findings with associated evidence snippets and rule IDs.
      7. Access to the metrics dashboard is restricted to users with an 'Admin' role.

      - [ ] **Backend:** Instrument API endpoints to capture performance metrics (p95 latency). (AC: 3)
      - [ ] **Backend:** Implement a service to collect and aggregate metrics for the document processing pipeline (`tokens_per_doc`, `%docs_invoking_LLM`, explainability rate). (AC: 5, 6)
      - [ ] **Backend:** Create a new API endpoint to expose the collected metrics data. (AC: 1)
      - [ ] **Backend:** Implement an alerting system to notify administrators of system health issues. (AC: 4)
      - [ ] **Frontend:** Create a new admin-only dashboard page for displaying metrics. (AC: 1, 7)
      - [ ] **Frontend:** Develop visual charts and graphs to display the key KPIs on the dashboard. (AC: 2)
      - [ ] **Frontend:** Integrate the dashboard with the backend metrics endpoint to display real-time data. (AC: 1)

    title: Dev Notes
    instruction: |
      Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
      - Do not invent information
      - If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
      - If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
      - Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks

      - **Tech Stack:** The frontend is a Next.js application. The backend is a Python FastAPI application.
      - **Authentication:** The application uses role-based access control. Ensure the new dashboard page is only accessible by users with the 'Admin' role.
      - **Data Visualization:** Use a library like Recharts or Chart.js for creating the charts and graphs on the frontend.
      - **Metrics Collection:** Consider using a library like Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics on the backend.
      - **Alerting:** The alerting system could be integrated with a service like PagerDuty or send notifications via email or Slack.
      - **Token Metrics:** Integration with the token ledger (Story 2.4) will be necessary for accurate token metrics.

  - id: testing-standards

      - **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the new backend services and API endpoints.
      - **Integration Tests:** Create integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow of metrics collection and display.
      - **Frontend Tests:** Write component tests for the new dashboard page and its components.
      - **E2E Tests:** Add end-to-end tests to simulate an admin user viewing the metrics dashboard.
      - **Security Tests:** Ensure that the new endpoint and dashboard page are properly secured and only accessible by admin users.
