title: Upload & Job Orchestration
status: draft
story: |
  As a user, I want to upload a contract file (PDF/DOCX) so that the system can process it and provide analysis.
acceptance_criteria:
  - POST /contracts accepts PDF/DOCX ≤10MB; returns job_id
  - GET /jobs/{id} returns status: queued|running|done|error (+ error reason)
  - On done, analysis record exists with filename, size, created_at
  - Latency budget: enqueue < 500ms server time
notes:
  - Virus/size checks server‑side; signed upload URL optional
