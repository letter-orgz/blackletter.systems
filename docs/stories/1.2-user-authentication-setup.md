**Status:** Draft

**Story:**
As a **User**,
I want to **be able to sign up and log in to the application**,
so that **I can securely access my dashboard and analysis features.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A basic login/signup UI is created with fields for email and password.
2. The UI components integrate with the Supabase Auth client for user sign-up and sign-in functionality.
3. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the `/dashboard` page.
4. The `middleware.ts` file is implemented to protect the `/dashboard` route, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
5. The logged-in user's session is successfully established using the secure cookie method provided by Supabase.
6. A "Log Out" button is present and functional, clearing the user's session and redirecting them to the login page.
