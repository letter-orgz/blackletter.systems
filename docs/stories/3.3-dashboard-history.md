title: Dashboard History (Analyses list)
status: draft
story: |
  As a reviewer, I want to see a list of my recent analyses with quick verdict summaries so that I can reopen a past analysis or export a report without re-uploading.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Lists recent analyses with filename, created_at, size, and verdict chips (Pass/Weak/Missing/Needs review counts)
  - Empty state: "No analyses yet. Drag a contract to start." with a CTA to /new
  - Row click navigates to Findings view at /analyses/:id
  - Supports basic filtering (by verdict) and text search by filename (client-side for MVP)
  - Paginates or shows the most recent N (e.g., 50) analyses
  - Data loads via a list endpoint (e.g., GET /api/analyses?limit=50); errors surface with retry
notes:
  - Derived from UI/UX spec (Dashboard) and PRD outcomes; complements Stories 1.1, 3.1, and 3.2
  - Verdict chips should be accessible (ARIA labels); color not the only signal
  - Consider skeleton/loading states and empty/error visuals
