title: Dashboard History (Analyses list)
status: draft
story: |
  As a reviewer, I want to see a list of my recent analyses with quick verdict summaries so that I can reopen a past analysis or export a report without re-uploading.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Lists recent analyses with filename, created_at, size, and verdict chips (Pass/Weak/Missing/Needs review counts)
  - Empty state: "No analyses yet. Drag a contract to start." with a CTA to /new
  - Row click navigates to Findings view at /analyses/:id
  - Supports basic filtering (by verdict) and text search by filename (client-side for MVP)
  - Paginates or shows the most recent N (e.g., 50) analyses
  - Data loads via a list endpoint (e.g., GET /api/analyses?limit=50); errors surface with retry
notes:
  - Derived from UI/UX spec (Dashboard) and PRD outcomes; complements Stories 1.1, 3.1, and 3.2
  - Verdict chips should be accessible (ARIA labels); color not the only signal
  - Consider skeleton/loading states and empty/error visuals

    - api: GET /api/analyses?limit=50 list with verdict counts
    - ui: /dashboard list + empty state + navigation
    - client: Filters by verdict + filename search
    - tests: API shape/paging + UI empty/error states

### dev_spec

- API: `GET /api/analyses?limit=50&query=&verdict=` returns items with `{id, filename, created_at, size, verdict_counts}` and optional paging cursor.
- UI: `/dashboard` shows recent N analyses, empty-state CTA to `/new`, row click navigates to `/analyses/:id`; client-side filter/search.
- States: skeleton during load; error with retry.

### qa_tests

- API paging shape; empty and error cases.
- UI filters/search work; empty-state renders; navigation correct.
- A11y: chips have ARIA; color not sole signal.
