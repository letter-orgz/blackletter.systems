**ID**: 0.2
**Epic**: 0  Landing (Marketing)
**Status**: **Approved**
**Goal**: Deliver a minimal, accessible landing page with a clear hero and CTAs: "Start Free 14-Day Trial" linking to `/new` and "Try the Demo" linking to `/dashboard` (demo mode), independent of backend.

## Context

- Route: `/`.
- Independent of `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` (static content), but CTAs target the trial and demo flows.
- Deployable to Vercel immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Responsive hero section with a concise value proposition and sub copy.
2. Primary CTA "Start Free 14-Day Trial" links to `/new`; secondary CTA "Try the Demo" links to `/dashboard`.
3. WCAG AA: sufficient contrast, keyboard navigable, visible focus, semantic headings.
4. Metadata: `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, Open Graph tags, favicon.
5. No backend assumptions; page loads fast and statically.

## Interfaces

- None. Static page only.

## dev_agent_record

**proposed_tasks**

- [x] Add landing page with hero, sub-copy, and CTAs to `/new` and `/dashboard`.
- [x] Provide basic SEO metadata (title, description, OG).

- [ ] Optional: add a small "How it works" section linking to `/dashboard` and `/analyses/mock-1` when in demo mode.

**agent_model_used**

- dev

**file_list**

- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (landing with CTAs to `/new` and `/dashboard`)
- apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx (metadata/OG)

**change_log**

- feat(web): landing CTAs for trial and demo
- chore(web): add metadata

**completion_notes**

- CTAs direct to trial and demo; metadata present; accessibility preserved; optional section deferred.

**decisions**

- Keep styling minimal (Tailwind utility classes) to avoid design debt.
- Root route serves landing page directly; no redirect needed.

**notes**

- This page is fully independent; can ship to production early and evolve later.

### dev_spec

- Route: `/`.
- Files: landing page, root layout metadata, favicon.
- Content: hero value prop + CTAs “Start Free 14-Day Trial” → `/new`; “Try the Demo” → `/dashboard`.
- A11y/SEO: semantic headings, OG tags, AA contrast.

### qa_tests

- Links: `/new` trial link and `/dashboard` demo link work.
- SEO: title/description/OG present; favicon loads.
- A11y: headings/landmarks; visible focus; contrast AA.
