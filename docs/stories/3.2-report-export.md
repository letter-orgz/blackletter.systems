title: Report Export (PDF/HTML)
status: draft
story: |
  As a reviewer, I want to export the findings for a contract analysis into a PDF or HTML report so that I can share the results or archive them.
acceptance_criteria:
  - PDF/HTML export with headings, verdicts, snippets, timestamps
  - Include file metadata (name, checksum)
  - Asset is reproducible from stored artefacts
notes:
  - Frontend action to trigger export, backend service to generate it.
  - Use headless Chromium for HTML->PDF conversion as per architecture.
  - Report layout and styling need to be defined.
  - Exported file should be accessible via a URL or direct download.
