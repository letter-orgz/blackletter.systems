**Status:** Draft

**Story:**
As a **logged-in User**,
I want to **view the detailed results of a specific analysis**,
so that **I can understand the compliance findings for my contract.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A "Findings View" page is created at the dynamic route `/analyses/[id]`.
2. On page load, the frontend uses the `analysisId` from the URL to fetch data from the `GET /analyses/{analysisId}` and `GET /analyses/{analysisId}/findings` endpoints using the appropriate React Query hooks.
3. While data is loading, the skeleton loader UI, as designed in the UI/UX Specification, is displayed.
4. If either API call returns an error, a user-friendly error message is displayed on the page.
5. When data is loaded, the page header correctly displays the contract's name and the "Export Report" button.
6. The "Verdict Summary Chips" are displayed with the correct counts and are functional, filtering the main findings table when clicked.
7. The "Findings Table" is rendered, displaying a row for each finding with its detector name and verdict, matching the wireframe design.
8. Clicking on a finding row opens the "Evidence Drawer" component, which correctly displays the snippet, rationale, and other details for that specific finding.
