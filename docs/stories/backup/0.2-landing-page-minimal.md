title: Landing Page (Minimal)
status: Draft
story: |
  As a visitor, I want to see a minimal, accessible landing page with a clear hero and a "Try the Demo" CTA linking to `/dashboard` (demo mode), so that I can quickly understand the product and try it out.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Responsive hero section with a concise value proposition and sub-copy.
  - Primary CTA "Try the Demo" links to `/dashboard`; secondary "Read the PRD" links to docs (optional).
  - WCAG AA: sufficient contrast, keyboard navigable, visible focus, semantic headings.
  - Metadata: `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, Open Graph tags, favicon.
  - No backend assumptions; page loads fast and statically.
