Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 88/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

(None identified - highest risk is High)

## High Priority Risks

### 1. [TECH-001]: Schema Validation Rigidity
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - New rulepack versions or custom rulepacks might introduce schema variations not fully anticipated.
**Impact**: High (3) - Could lead to system-wide failure to load rules, preventing contract analysis.
**Mitigation**:
- Strategy: `preventive`
- Actions:
  - Implement detailed error messages for schema validation failures.
  - Consider a more flexible schema validation approach if future extensibility is planned.
  - Document the strict schema requirements clearly for rulepack creators.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Unit tests for various schema violation scenarios.
- Residual Risk: Low - With good error reporting, impact is mitigated.
- Owner: `dev`
- Timeline: `Before deployment`

### 2. [DATA-001]: Lexicon Loading Failure
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Lexicon files might be missing, misnamed, or corrupted.
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Specific detectors relying on the lexicon will fail, potentially leading to incomplete analysis.
**Mitigation**:
- Strategy: `preventive`
- Actions:
  - Ensure robust error handling when loading individual lexicon files.
  - Log specific errors for missing or invalid lexicon files.
  - Consider making detectors explicitly handle missing lexicons gracefully (e.g., disable detector).
- Testing Requirements:
  - Integration tests for missing/invalid lexicon file scenarios.
- Residual Risk: Low - Error handling mitigates impact.
- Owner: `dev`
- Timeline: `Before deployment`

### 3. [OPS-001]: Hot-Reload in Non-Production Environments
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - If hot-reload is enabled in dev/staging by misconfiguration.
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could lead to inconsistent rule states or performance issues during development/testing.
**Mitigation**:
- Strategy: `preventive`
- Actions:
  - Double-check environment variable logic to ensure hot-reload is strictly disabled in production.
  - Add a configuration check at startup to log the hot-reload status.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Environment-specific configuration tests.
- Residual Risk: Low - Clear logging and strict checks reduce risk.
- Owner: `dev`
- Timeline: `Before deployment`

### 4. [MAINT-001]: Test Coverage Gap
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: High (3) - The story task explicitly mentions it, and it's noted in the existing QA Results.
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Missing a specific test for an error condition reduces confidence in its robustness.
**Mitigation**:
- Strategy: `corrective`
- Actions:
  - Implement the missing unit test for unknown lexicon references.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Add the test case to the unit test suite.
- Residual Risk: Minimal - Once the test is added.
- Owner: `dev`
- Timeline: `Before Done`

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                       | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Schema Validation Rigidity                        | Medium (2)  | High (3)| 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Lexicon Loading Failure                           | Medium (2)  | Medium (2)| 4   | Medium   |
| OPS-001  | Hot-Reload in Non-Production Environments         | Medium (2)  | Medium (2)| 4   | Medium   |
| MAINT-001| Test Coverage Gap (Unknown Lexicon)               | High (3)    | Medium (2)| 4   | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Test scenarios for strict schema validation failures (TECH-001).
- Test scenarios for various lexicon loading failures (DATA-001).
  - Required test types: Unit and Integration tests for rulepack loader.
  - Test data requirements: Invalid YAML files, rulepacks with missing/unknown lexicon references.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Test scenarios for hot-reload behavior in different environments (OPS-001).
- Ensure the missing test for unknown lexicon references is implemented and passes (MAINT-001).

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for happy path loading and API summary.
- Regression test suite for existing functionality.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Implement the missing test for unknown lexicon references (MAINT-001).
- Ensure robust error handling for schema and lexicon issues (TECH-001, DATA-001).

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Clear logging and documentation for schema/lexicon requirements (TECH-001, DATA-001).
- Confirmation of hot-reload status logging (OPS-001).

### Accepted Risks

(None documented at this time.)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Error rates related to rulepack loading failures.
- Logs for schema validation errors.
- Logs for lexicon loading errors.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New rulepack schemas are introduced.
- Lexicon loading mechanism changes.
- Hot-reload logic is modified.
- New security vulnerabilities are discovered related to YAML processing.
