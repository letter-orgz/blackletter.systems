# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-08-29
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - No specific security measures for rule loading mentioned
- Performance: PASS - Loading at startup with caching is efficient
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling for invalid YAML/missing fields is implemented
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage has a gap for unknown lexicon references

## Critical Issues

1. **Missing Test for Unknown Lexicon Reference** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Incomplete test coverage for a specific error condition mentioned in tasks.
   - Fix: Add a unit test that asserts a `RulepackError` when a detector references a non-existent lexicon filename/name. (As noted in the story's existing QA Results)

2. **Lack of Specific Security Measures** (Security)
   - Risk: The rule loading process doesn't explicitly mention security validations (e.g., preventing loading of maliciously crafted YAML).
   - Fix: Ensure the YAML loader is secure (e.g., avoids arbitrary code execution) and consider adding validation for the source of the rulepack file if it's user-provided in any admin context.

## Quick Wins

- Add the missing unit test for unknown lexicon references: ~1 hour
- Review YAML loading library for security best practices: ~30 minutes
- Align documentation/env var naming (`RULES_DIR` + `RULEPACK_FILE` vs `RULES_PATH`) to avoid confusion (as noted in story): ~30 minutes
