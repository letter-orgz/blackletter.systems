# Re-Run Story Checklist Validation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the validation of the top priority stories against the `story-draft-checklist.md` criteria. These stories are part of the initial MVP plan (Sprint A) and have statuses 'aligned' or 'Done', indicating readiness for development or having been developed.

The validation was performed on the following stories:
- `1.1-upload-job-orchestration.md`
- `1.2-text-extraction.md`
- `1.3-evidence-window-builder.md`
- `2.1-rulepack-loader.md`
- `2.2-detector-runner.md`

## Validation Results Summary

### 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Issues**: None. All stories clearly state the functionality to be implemented ("As a ... I want to ... so that ..."). The relationship to epic goals and the system flow is evident. Dependencies (e.g., 2.2 on 2.1/1.3) are noted. Business value/context is clear from the user story perspective.

### 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Issues**: None. Stories provide clear `dev_spec` sections detailing key files (`services/*.py`, `routers/*.py`), APIs, and persistence details. Technologies (PyMuPDF, blingfire) are mentioned where relevant. Integration points and data models are described or referenced.

### 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Issues**: While references to architecture documents like `tech_stack.md` and `source_tree.md` are implied and correct, the stories themselves often refer generally to these documents rather than specific sections (e.g., `docs/architecture/tech_stack.md#pdf-libraries`). However, the `dev_spec` and `qa_tests` sections within the stories effectively summarize the critical technical information needed.

### 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Issues**: None. The `dev_spec` and `qa_tests` sections make these stories largely self-contained. Domain terms (e.g., "evidence window", "rulepack") are used consistently and can be understood from context or the core architectural documentation, which is part of the "dev-load-always" set. Assumptions are implicit but reasonable given the project context.

### 5. TESTING GUIDANCE
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Issues**: None. Each story includes a `qa_tests` section that outlines the required testing approach (unit, integration), identifies key test scenarios, and defines success criteria. The `qa_results` section in 'Done' stories confirms these tests were executed.

## Specific Findings and Recommendations

1.  **Readiness**: All reviewed stories ('aligned' or 'Done') are READY for development or have been successfully developed and tested. They meet the criteria for sufficient context, technical guidance, and testability.
2.  **Reference Specificity**: A minor improvement would be for future stories or templates to encourage pointing to specific sections within referenced documents, although this was not a major hindrance for these stories.
3.  **Consistency**: The structure, especially the inclusion of `dev_spec` and `qa_tests`, greatly enhances clarity and readiness. This pattern should be maintained.

## Overall Assessment

- **READY**: All stories validated are ready for implementation or have been implemented.
- **Clarity Score (Average)**: 9/10
- **Major Gaps Identified**: None
