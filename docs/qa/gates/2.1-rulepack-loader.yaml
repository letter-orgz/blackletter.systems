gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Implementation is sound and meets core requirements. Unit tests cover the happy path and several error conditions. However, there is a test coverage gap identified in the story''s own QA Results and confirmed by this review: a specific unit test for handling unknown lexicon references is missing, though the logic to handle it is present. This represents a medium-severity risk to maintainability.'
