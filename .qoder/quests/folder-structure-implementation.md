# Blackletter - Documentation Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating the missing documentation structure and files for the Blackletter project.

## Executive Summary

The Blackletter project is missing critical documentation files that are referenced in the existing architecture specification. This implementation plan addresses the gaps by creating the necessary documentation structure and content to support development, testing, and deployment of the GDPR Processor Obligations Checker.

The documentation will follow the structure referenced in the architecture document and will include detailed information about technology choices, coding standards, source tree organization, API contracts, and a comprehensive product requirements document with business context.

## 1. Folder Structure Implementation

We'll create the following structure:
```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── tech_stack.md
│   ├── coding_standards.md
│   ├── source_tree.md
│   └── api_contracts.md
├── prd.md
└── stories/
```

## 2. Documentation Files to Create

- Performance and compatibility considerations

**Content Plan**:
- Overview of the technology stack

- Backend technologies (Python 3.11+, FastAPI 0.11x, Uvicorn, PyMuPDF, python-docx, blingfire)
- Storage technologies (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- Infrastructure (Supabase)
- Tooling and QA (Pytest, Vitest/Playwright, Ruff/Black, ESLint/Prettier)
- Optional technologies (pytesseract, Tesseract OCR)
- Version locking strategy
- Technology evaluation criteria
- Future technology considerations
- Technology comparison matrix

### 2.2 docs/architecture/coding_standards.md
- Detailed coding standards for Python and TypeScript
- Linting and formatting rules
- Testing conventions

**Content Plan**:
- Python coding standards (Ruff/Black enforcement, pydantic v2, async guidelines)
- TypeScript/React coding standards (functional components, hooks, React Query)

- File naming conventions

**Content Plan**:
- Complete directory structure with explanations
- Module organization principles
- File naming conventions
- Code placement guidelines
- Configuration file locations
- Test file organization
- Documentation placement

**Detailed Content Structure**:
- **Root Directory Structure**:
  - `apps/` - Contains both frontend and backend applications
  - `apps/web/` - Next.js frontend application
  - `apps/api/` - FastAPI backend application
  - `docs/` - Project documentation
  - `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation
  - `docs/prd/` - Product requirements documentation
  - `docs/stories/` - User story documentation

- **Frontend Structure** (`apps/web/`):
  - `app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `lib/` - Utility functions and custom hooks
  - `styles/` - Global styles and theme configuration
  - `public/` - Static assets

- **Backend Structure** (`apps/api/`):
  - `blackletter_api/` - Main application package
  - `blackletter_api/main.py` - Application entry point
  - `blackletter_api/config.py` - Configuration management
  - `blackletter_api/routers/` - API route handlers
  - `blackletter_api/services/` - Business logic services
  - `blackletter_api/rules/` - Rulepack definitions
  - `blackletter_api/models/` - Data models and schemas
  - `blackletter_api/tests/` - Test files

- **Module Organization Principles**:
  - Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
  - Feature-based organization within each application
  - Clear boundaries between business logic and presentation layers
  - Consistent naming conventions across modules

- **File Naming Conventions**:
  - Python files: `snake_case.py`
  - TypeScript files: `PascalCase.tsx` for components, `camelCase.ts` for utilities
  - Test files: `test_*.py` for Python, `*.test.ts` for TypeScript
  - Configuration files: descriptive names with clear purposes

### 2.4 docs/architecture/api_contracts.md
- Detailed API endpoint specifications
- Request/response schemas
- Error handling patterns

**Content Plan**:
- API design principles
- Detailed endpoint specifications
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Error handling patterns and codes
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Rate limiting and security considerations
- API versioning strategy

### 2.5 docs/prd.md
- Comprehensive PRD with business context
- Market analysis and competitive landscape
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Content Plan**:
- Executive summary and vision
- Market size and opportunity analysis
- Competitive landscape and differentiation
- Target market segments with demographics
- Business objectives and revenue model
- Go-to-market strategy and pricing
- Technical requirements (availability, disaster recovery, i18n, etc.)
- Implementation planning (methodology, team structure, communication plan)
- Success metrics and KPIs (technical and business)
- Risk management (probability/impact matrix, mitigation strategies)
- Legal and compliance considerations (GDPR, data protection)
