# Blackletter - Technology Stack

This document provides a detailed overview of the technology stack for the Blackletter project, with justifications for each choice.

## 1. Overview

The technology stack is designed to be deterministic, explainable, and production-ready for the MVP. It prioritizes Windows-friendly development workflows, low cost, and a rules-first engine with LLM usage disabled by default.

## 2. Frontend

-   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
-   **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x
-   **UI Components**: shadcn/ui utilizing Radix primitives
-   **Icons**: lucide-react
-   **Data Fetching**: React Query for managing server state

## 3. Backend

-   **Language**: Python 3.11+
-   **Framework**: FastAPI 0.11x with Uvicorn
-   **Document Extraction**: PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF and python-docx/docx2python for DOCX
-   **Sentence Segmentation**: blingfire, chosen for being fast and Windows-friendly
-   **Optional OCR**: Tesseract via pytesseract (disabled by default)
-   **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.x
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic 2.7.x

## 4. Storage & Infrastructure

-   **Development Database**: SQLite for simplicity and file-backed storage
-   **Cloud Database**: PostgreSQL (specifically via Supabase)
-   **File Storage**: Local filesystem in development; object storage (e.g., Supabase Storage) in the cloud
-   **Asynchronous Jobs**: FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` are used for the MVP, with a planned upgrade path to Celery with Redis for more durable queueing

## 5. Tooling & QA

-   **Backend Testing**: Pytest and pytest-asyncio
-   **Frontend Testing**: Vitest and Playwright
-   **Python Linting/Formatting**: Ruff and Black
-   **TypeScript Linting/Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier

## 6. Version Locking Strategy

-   A strict version pinning policy will be followed.
-   Exact versions for all packages will be recorded in `versions.lock.md` at the start of the project, in addition to standard lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `requirements.txt`).

## 7. Trade-offs & Alternatives

-   **BackgroundTasks vs. Celery**: The project will start with the simpler `BackgroundTasks` for the MVP and feature-flag a move to Celery for its durable retries and parallelism in a later phase.
-   **SQLite vs. Postgres**: Development starts on SQLite for speed, while production will use Postgres for concurrency and scale. The transition will be managed by a repository layer and Alembic migrations.
-   **PDF Rendering**: Headless Chromium is the chosen method for generating PDF reports due to its consistent CSS handling, over alternatives like wkhtmltopdf which can have CSS quirks.

### 2.2 docs/architecture/coding_standards.md
- Detailed coding standards for Python and TypeScript
- Linting and formatting rules
- Testing conventions

- File naming conventions
- Code organization principles
- Documentation standards
- Testing conventions (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code review guidelines

**Actual Content**:

# Blackletter - Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards, conventions, and best practices for the Blackletter project.

## 1. Python (Backend)

-   **Linting & Formatting**: Ruff and Black are strictly enforced. All code must be formatted with Black before merging.
-   **Type Hinting**: Use explicit types. Pydantic v2 models are required for all API request and response schemas.
-   **Asynchronous Code**: Use `async` endpoints for I/O-bound operations to maintain performance.
-   **Code Organization**: Business logic must reside in `services/` modules. API route handlers in `routers/` should be thin and only handle request/response orchestration.

## 2. TypeScript/React (Frontend)

-   **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier are strictly enforced.
-   **Component Style**: Use functional components with hooks. Avoid class components.
-   **State Management**: Use React Query for all server state, caching, and data fetching logic. Custom hooks abstracting React Query calls should be placed in `web/lib/`.
-   **UI Logic**: The UI should remain evidence-first, avoiding heavy global state management where possible.

## 3. Testing Conventions

-   **Unit Tests**:
    -   Backend unit tests will be written using Pytest.
    -   Detector logic must be tested with a minimum of 3 positive and 3 hard negative examples to start.
    -   Frontend unit/integration tests will use Vitest.
-   **Integration Tests**:
    -   Focus on the end-to-end flow from upload to findings generation.
    -   Selected API responses should be snapshot tested to prevent regressions.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    -   Playwright will be used to test critical user flows like document upload, reviewing the findings table, and exporting a report.

# Blackletter - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version**: 1.0
**Owner (PM)**: John

## 1. Vision & Goals

**Vision**: To shrink vendor-contract GDPR review from hours to minutes with explainable, deterministic checks against GDPR Art. 28(3), with each check backed by pinpoint citations and clear rationale.

**Primary Goals (MVP)**
- Deliver 8 obligation checks from Art. 28(3)(a)–(h) with **Pass / Weak / Missing / Needs review** verdicts.
- Show the **"why"** for every finding, including the rule ID, a text snippet, and its location.
- Provide an **exportable report** (PDF/HTML) suitable for sharing with stakeholders.
- Operate with low cost and tight latency at a small scale.

**Non‑Goals (MVP)**
- Automated redlining or clause rewriting.
- Multi-jurisdictional support beyond UK/EU GDPR.
- Batch processing, collaboration features, or workflow automation.

## 2. Users & Personas

-   **DPO / Data Protection Lead (Primary)**: Needs evidence-backed checks to speed up reviews.
-   **In‑house Counsel**: Wants consistent, defensible screening before deep legal work.
-   **External Solicitor**: Needs quick triage and a client-friendly exportable report.
-   **SME Founder/Ops**: Requires a sanity check on vendor DPAs during procurement.

## 3. Scope (MVP)

-   **File Ingestion**: Upload PDF/DOCX files up to 10MB via an asynchronous job model.
-   **Text Extraction**: Extract text with a page map and sentence index. OCR is optional and off by default.
-   **Rule-Driven Detection**: Run the `art28_v1` rulepack to compute verdicts for each detector.
-   **Findings UI**: A table/card view with verdict coloring, filters, search, and a detail panel showing the snippet, rule ID, and rationale.
-   **Report Export**: Generate a PDF/HTML export containing findings, snippets, and metadata.
-   **History**: A list of prior analyses with basic metadata and a verdict summary.
-   **Settings**: Toggles for LLM provider (default: none), OCR, retention policy, and token budget.

## 4. Quality Attributes & KPIs

-   **Latency**: p95 ≤ 60s end-to-end for a ≤10MB PDF.
-   **Cost**: ≤ £0.10 per document at default settings.
-   **Accuracy**: Precision ≥ 0.85 and Recall ≥ 0.90 on the Gold Set v1.
-   **Explainability**: ≥ 95% of findings must include the snippet and rule ID.
-   **Coverage**: No undetected topics among the eight detectors for a compliant DPA.
-   **Security**: LLM is disabled by default and, if enabled, is restricted to a snippet-only gate. No PII is stored unless retention is explicitly enabled.

## 5. Epics (MVP)

-   **Epic 1 — Ingestion & Extraction**: Users upload files; the service creates text, a page map, and a sentence index.
-   **Epic 2 — Rule Engine & Detection**: Deterministic checks produce verdicts and evidence.
-   **Epic 3 — Findings & Report UI**: A clear, evidence-first UI and exports.
-   **Epic 4 — Metrics & Observability**: Visibility into performance and costs.
