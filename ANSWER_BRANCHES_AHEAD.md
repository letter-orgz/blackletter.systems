## Key Insights

1. **Almost all branches are ahead**: Only the `main` branch itself is not ahead of main
2. **Heavy divergence**: Most branches have "diverged" status, meaning they have significant differences from main
3. **Copilot branches lead**: The branches with the most commits ahead are automated copilot fix branches
4. **Active development**: This indicates very active development across many feature branches
5. **Potential merge conflicts**: With so many diverged branches, merging could be complex

## Branch Status Distribution

- **Diverged**: 38 branches (95%)
- **Ahead**: 2 branches (5%)
